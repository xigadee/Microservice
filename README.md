![Xigadee](/docs/X2a.png)

Xigadee is an open-source Microservice framework, developed by [Paul Stancer](https://github.com/paulstancer) and [Guy Steel](https://github.com/guysteel), and originally released under the Apache 2 license by Hitachi Consulting in 2016. You are free to use it within your own commercial applications without restriction. 

The framework is a result of our experience - and frustration - over the past five years, in building large-scale distributed cloud applications for our enterprise customers.

We found that when constructing Microservices, we could spend as much time on building and testing the repeatable "plumbing" code (messaging, monitoring, communication, security etc.) as we did on the actual application business logic. 

So our goal with Xigadee is to solve that challenge. To provide a consistent development approach; and more importantly - a set of reusable tools that we can apply to any type of Microservice application - while removing the drudgery and overhead of "re-inventing the Microservice-wheel" each time we construct a new distributed solution.

**_Please note: the current main branch of the code is being converted to support both .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.7 ready for release 2 of Xigadee. Ideally you should have Visual Studio 2017 v15.4 or later to build._**

## A quick demonstration

The Xigadee libraries are built using Microsoft's .NET technology, and have specific accelerators to target Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) technologies in the Azure stack.

All the libraries utilise a simple declarative programming model to aid in the construction of the Microservice. 

A quick sample of code from [this](Src/Test/Test.Xigadee/Samples/PersistenceLocal.cs) unit test shows how a Microservice can be quickly constructed within a few lines of code. This code can be found in the '_PersistenceSingle_' method:
```C#
PersistenceClient<Guid, Sample1> repo;

var p1 = new MicroservicePipeline("Local")
    .AddChannelIncoming("request")
        .AttachPersistenceManagerHandlerMemory(
              keyMaker: (Sample1 e) => e.Id
            , keyDeserializer: (s) => new Guid(s)
            , versionPolicy: ((e) => e.VersionId.ToString("N").ToUpperInvariant(), (e) => e.VersionId = Guid.NewGuid(), true)
        )
        .AttachPersistenceClient(out repo)
        .Revert()
    ;

p1.Start();

var sample = new Sample1() { Message = "Hello mom" };
var id = sample.Id;
//Run a set of simple version entity tests.
//Create
Assert.IsTrue(repo.Create(sample).Result.IsSuccess);
//Read
var result = repo.Read(id).Result;
Assert.IsTrue(result.IsSuccess);
Assert.IsTrue(result.Entity.Message == "Hello mom");
```
This service creates a quick memory-based entity store for the POCO class, Sample1, that supports CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) functions for the entity, with optimistic locking, and additional versioning and search methods, based on a key field (Id) and optional version field (VersionId) that are defined in the entity. 

If we were to use the [Xigadee Azure](Src/Xigadee.Azure/_docs/Introduction.md) library, we could replace the following method:
```C#
.AttachPersistenceManagerHandlerMemory(
```
with this method, which would switch it to use a DocumentDb (now CosmosDb) backed entity store:
```C#
.AttachPersistenceManagerDocumentDbSdk(
```                       
or this method to use a Azure Blob Storage collection instead:
 ```C#
.AttachPersistenceManagerAzureBlobStorage(
```

## Feedback
Xigadee is in active development across a number of development projects, and is still very much a work-in-progress; we are still improving the code, extending the unit-test coverage, adding new features, and providing more detailed documentation and code examples.

We have recently shipped release 1.1 of the Framework, which has some key improvements in creating custom application logic. Our next version will be 2.0 which will be built under the .NET Standard 2.0, which will allow Xigadee applications to work with both traditional .NET Framework libraries, but also to use the new .NET Core multi-platform capabilities, such as Linux and ARM based systems.

 We welcome feedback and suggestions for future features of the Framework. More importantly, if you are using the libraries and discover a bug, please report it [here](https://github.com/xigadee/Microservice/issues/new) so we can track and fix it.
